        # WORKAROUND 17/04/2025: The following code is a workaround for the "File is stale and needs to be rebuilt" error
        # This occurs when AMD modules import Moodle core dependencies
        # See issue: https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-plugin-ci/issues/350
        # This workaround should be removed once the issue is fixed upstream

        # Go to moodle directory
